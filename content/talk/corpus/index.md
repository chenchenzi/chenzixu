summary: Introduction to pipeline and tools for phonetic research using large-scale speech corpora.
abstract: "Large-scale speech datasets are increasingly central to research. This talk provides a practical overview of end-to-end workflows for working with large speech corpora, from acquisition and storage to preprocessing and querying. We will compare popular management ecosystems, including the file-based Kaldi style and the Hugging Face Datasets API, highlighting their respective advantages for annotation, scalability, and interoperability. Participants will learn how to adapt pre-trained large speech models such as Whisper, structure and validate metadata, efficiently query and filter large datasets, and leverage modern tools for distributed processing.
