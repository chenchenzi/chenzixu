###Definition and Significance]
.right-column[The **sampling distribution of means** is **normal**, provided two conditions are met: 
(a) the sample size should be **large** enough
(b) $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are defined for the probability density or mass function that generated the data. 


We can derive an estimate of the distribution of (hypothetical) sample means from a single sample of n independent data points

CLT is NOT the distribution that generated the data, but the sampling distribution of the sample means under **repeated sampling**.

Thus the sample mean is **t** standard errors away from the hypothesized mean: $$t= \dfrac{\bar{y}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

# Formal forms

A simple example of linear model is
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + e_i$$
Where $Y_i$ is the measured value of the dependent variable for observation i; $X_i$ is the explanatory variable or predictor; $Y_i$ is modelled in terms of an intercept $\beta_0$ plus the effect of predictor $X_i$ weighted by coefficient $\beta_1$ and error term $e_i$.

.right-col[
Simulated data illustrating linear model $Y_i = 3+2X_i+e_i$.
The most common method for fitting a regression line is **least-squares**.

A linear model is a model that is **linear in the coefficients**; each coefficient is only allowed to be set to the power of one.

Non-linear relationships can be analysed using a linear model.]

???
LME an extension of the General Linear Model that underlies simpler approaches such as ANOVA, t-test, and classical regression.
Many people assume that 'linear models' can only capture linear relationships, i.e., relationships that can be described by a straight line (or a plane). This is false.
A linear model is a weighted sum of various terms, and each term has a single predictor (or a constant) that is multiplied by a coefficient.

`attitudepol` is the slope for the categorical effect of politeness.

Pitch is lower in polite speech than in informal speech, by about 20 Hz.

# Understanding the output
#### Coding schemes
A categorical variable of $n$ levels is entered into a regression analysis as a sequence of $n-1$ variables. Generally or by default in R, we use dummy coding for them.

```{r comment='#'}
contrasts(data$attitude)

# change the reference level
contrasts(data$attitude) = contr.treatment(2, base = 2)
contrasts(data$attitude)
```

There are also other coding schemes such as **effects coding** including **contrast coding**, **sum coding** and **Helmert coding**. Different coding system may help answer different research questions. It also greatly changes the way you interpret your output.

# Understanding the output
#### Statistical significance
Unfortunately, p-values for mixed models aren’t as straightforward as they are for the linear model. There are multiple approaches, and there’s a discussion surrounding these, with sometimes wildly differing opinions about which approach is the best.

There is a package `lmerTest` that provides $p$ values in type I, II or III anova and summery tables for `lmer` model fits via Satterthwaite's degrees of freedom method or Kenward-Roger method.

```{r comment='#'}
library(lmerTest)
politeness.model = lmer(frequency ~ attitude + gender + (1|subject) + (1|scenario), data=data)
anova(politeness.model)
```

---
# Understanding the output
#### Statistical significance
Likelihood Ratio Test as a means to attain $p$ values. Likelihood is the probability of seeing the data you collected given your model. 
```{r comment='#'}
politeness.null = lmer(frequency ~ gender + (1|subject) + (1|scenario), data=data, REML=FALSE)
politeness.full = lmer(frequency ~ attitude + gender + (1|subject) + (1|scenario), data=data, REML=FALSE)

anova(politeness.null, politeness.full)
```

Despite individual variation, there is also consistency in how politeness affects the voice: for all of our speakers, the voice tends to go
down when speaking politely, but for some people it goes down slightly more so than for others.
???
The effect of politeness (`attitudepol`) is different for each subject and item. It’s always negative and many of the values are quite similar to each
other.
---
# Model selection

#### Interaction terms
An interaction, **`attitude:sex`**, occurs when one variable changes how another variable affects the response variable. Alternative notation: **`attitude*sex`** `= attitude + sex + attitude:sex`

#### Correlation between intercepts and slopes
Using **`||`** in `(1 + attitude || subject)` for example, you are forcing the correlation between the random slopes and the intercepts to be zero. 


#### Overfitting
overfitting occurs when your model has too small a sample size and too many predictor variables. You may get a warning / error that your model wouldn’t converge.

# Model selection

### How to choose your model?
**Depend on your research question and data structure**

.left-col[
- Exploratory VS confirmatory context

- Design variables (theoretical interests) VS control variables

- Data-driven (e.g. improve the model fit) VS Design-driven

- Top-down and Bottom-up
]
.right-col[
- Some prefer to proceed incrementally, taking time to examine data.

- One should always be cautious of creating a model that is too complex.

- Some researchers have shown via simulations that mixed models without random slopes have a relatively high Type I error rate (Schielzeth & Forstmeier, 2009; Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tilly, 2013)

- Barr et al. (2013) recommend that you should “keep it maximal” with respect to your random effects structure, at least for controlled experiments.
]
???
We were not interested in gender differences, but they are well worth
controlling for. This is why we had random slopes for the effect of attitude (by subjects and item) but not gender. 

If you have predictors that represent control variables, over which you do not intend to perform statistical tests, it is unlikely that random slopes are needed.
---
# Model selection

### Limitations

#### "Singular fit" warning or "not converging" error

- We need to simplify our model and remove the random slopes or insignificant terms
( `step()` does it automatically for you).


But what if we believe there might be some merit to having subject-specific slopes?

#### Bayes to the rescue
**Bayesian mixed effects method** are powerful alternatives to more commonly used Frequentist approaches.

Partial pooling happens when you treat a factor as a random instead of fixed in your analysis.

It would improve generalization to the population.

# Partial pooling
.pull-left[**When partial-pooling goes wrong...**
1. Vanishing confidence intervals (the model is too complex for the data to support).

1. Unintended Shrinkage.<sup>1</sup>

 - In 2016, George et al. showed that partial pooling can lead to artificially low predicted mortality rates for smaller hospitals. 

1. The number of random effect levels has a strong impact on the uncertainty of the estimate variance.<sup>2</sup>

### Goal: Reproducible

- Describe your model (i.e. specify all fixed and random effects, interactions, intercepts, and slopes).

- Mention that you checked assumptions, and that the assumptions are satisfied.

- Report significance and actual estimates for coefficients.

- Cite the relevant packages.

# Why LME model?

### Multilevel / Hierarchical / Nested data

- Within-subject factor? Repeated measures?

- Psedoreplications (multiple measurements within the same condition)?

- Multiple stimulus items?

???
In the sleepstudy data, you had the within-subject factor of Day (which is more a numeric variable, actually, than a factor; but it has multiple values varying within each participant).
