.left-column[
###Definition and Significance]
.right-column[The **sampling distribution of means** is **normal**, provided two conditions are met: 
(a) the sample size should be **large** enough
(b) $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are defined for the probability density or mass function that generated the data. 


We can derive an estimate of the distribution of (hypothetical) sample means from a single sample of n independent data points

CLT is NOT the distribution that generated the data, but the sampling distribution of the sample means under **repeated sampling**.

.right-column[1. Define the null hypothesis $\mu_0$
1. Given data of size $n$, estimate $\bar{y}$, standard deviation $s$, estimate the standard error $SE = s/{\sqrt{n}}$.
1. The distance between the sample mean and the hypothesized mean can be written in SE units as follows.$$ t \times SE = \bar{y} -\mu$$
Thus the sample mean is **t** standard errors away from the hypothesized mean: $$t= \dfrac{\bar{y}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$
1. Reject null hypothesis if the observed t-value is “large”.
1. Fail to reject the null hypothesis, if the observed t-value is “small”.

# Formal forms

A simple example of linear model is
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + e_i$$
Where $Y_i$ is the measured value of the dependent variable for observation i; $X_i$ is the explanatory variable or predictor; $Y_i$ is modelled in terms of an intercept $\beta_0$ plus the effect of predictor $X_i$ weighted by coefficient $\beta_1$ and error term $e_i$.
.left-col[
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(62)

dat <- tibble(X = runif(100, -3, 3),
              Y = 3 + 2 * X + rnorm(100))

ggplot(dat, aes(X, Y)) +

  geom_abline(intercept = 3, slope = 2, color = "#b682a0")

```
]
.right-col[
Simulated data illustrating linear model $Y_i = 3+2X_i+e_i$.
The most common method for fitting a regression line is **least-squares**.

A linear model is a model that is **linear in the coefficients**; each coefficient is only allowed to be set to the power of one.

Non-linear relationships can be analysed using a linear model.]

???
LME an extension of the General Linear Model that underlies simpler approaches such as ANOVA, t-test, and classical regression.
Many people assume that 'linear models' can only capture linear relationships, i.e., relationships that can be described by a straight line (or a plane). This is false.
A linear model is a weighted sum of various terms, and each term has a single predictor (or a constant) that is multiplied by a coefficient.

`attitudepol` is the slope for the categorical effect of politeness.

Pitch is lower in polite speech than in informal speech, by about 20 Hz.

`lmer()` took whatever comes first in the alphabet to be the reference level.

# Understanding the output
#### Coding schemes
A categorical variable of $n$ levels is entered into a regression analysis as a sequence of $n-1$ variables. Generally or by default in R, we use dummy coding for them.

```{r comment='#'}
contrasts(data$attitude)

# change the reference level
contrasts(data$attitude) = contr.treatment(2, base = 2)
contrasts(data$attitude)
```

There are also other coding schemes such as **effects coding** including **contrast coding**, **sum coding** and **Helmert coding**. Different coding system may help answer different research questions. It also greatly changes the way you interpret your output.

---
# Understanding the output
#### Statistical significance
Unfortunately, p-values for mixed models aren’t as straightforward as they are for the linear model. There are multiple approaches, and there’s a discussion surrounding these, with sometimes wildly differing opinions about which approach is the best.

There is a package `lmerTest` that provides $p$ values in type I, II or III anova and summery tables for `lmer` model fits via Satterthwaite's degrees of freedom method or Kenward-Roger method.

```{r comment='#'}
library(lmerTest)
politeness.model = lmer(frequency ~ attitude + gender + (1|subject) + (1|scenario), data=data)
anova(politeness.model)
```

---
# Understanding the output
#### Statistical significance
Likelihood Ratio Test as a means to attain $p$ values. Likelihood is the probability of seeing the data you collected given your model. 
```{r comment='#'}
politeness.null = lmer(frequency ~ gender + (1|subject) + (1|scenario), data=data, REML=FALSE)
politeness.full = lmer(frequency ~ attitude + gender + (1|subject) + (1|scenario), data=data, REML=FALSE)

anova(politeness.null, politeness.full)
```

Despite individual variation, there is also consistency in how politeness affects the voice: for all of our speakers, the voice tends to go
down when speaking politely, but for some people it goes down slightly more so than for others.
???
The effect of politeness (`attitudepol`) is different for each subject and item. It’s always negative and many of the values are quite similar to each
other.

# Model selection

#### Interaction terms
An interaction occurs when one variable changes how another variable affects the response variable.

#### Overfitting
overfitting occurs when your model has too small a sample size and too many predictor variables. You may get a warning that your model wouldn’t converge.

#### How to choose your model?
- **Depend on your research question and data structure**
- Some prefer to proceed incrementally, taking time to examine data. 
- One should always be cautious of creating a model that is too complex.
- Some researchers have shown via simulations that mixed models without random slopes have a relatively high Type I error rate (Schielzeth & Forstmeier, 2009; Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tilly, 2013)
- Barr et al.(2013) recommend that you should “keep it maximal” with respect to your random effects structure, at least for controlled experiments.

???
We were not interested in gender differences, but they are well worth
controlling for. This is why we had random slopes for the effect of attitude (by subjects and item) but not gender.

- If you'd like to create your own title slide, disable **xaringan**'s title slide with the `seal = FALSE` option of `moon_reader`.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        seal: false
    ```

---

# Some Tips

- There are several ways to build incremental slides. See [this presentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/incremental.html) for examples.

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that start with `*`, or are wrapped in `{{ }}`, or have trailing comments `#<<`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---


---

# Some Tips

An example of using the trailing comment `#<<` to highlight lines:

````markdown
`r ''````{r tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```
````

Output:

```{r tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(mpg, disp) + 
  geom_point() +   #<<
  geom_smooth()    #<<
```

---

# Some Tips

When you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option `highlight.output` to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, `highlight.output = TRUE` means highlighting all lines, and `highlight.output = c(1, 3)` means highlighting the first and third line.

````md
`r ''````{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}
head(iris)
```
````

```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3), echo=FALSE}
head(iris)
```

Question: what does `highlight.output = c(TRUE, FALSE)` mean? (Hint: think about R's recycling of vectors)

---

# Some Tips

- To make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because **xaringan** uses the online version by default (see the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader`).

- You can use `xaringan::summon_remark()` to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to `libs/remark-latest.min.js`.

- Then change the `chakra` option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js
    ```

- If you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses _Yanone Kaffeesatz_, _Droid Serif_, and _Source Code Pro_), they won't work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app [google-webfonts-helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.

---

# Macros


---

# Macros (continued)



---

# CSS

Among all options in `xaringan::moon_reader`, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is `css`, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.

You can see the default CSS file [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan/resources/default.css). You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page `?xaringan::moon_reader` for more information.

---

# CSS

For example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default "Source Code Pro" to "Ubuntu Mono". You can create a CSS file named, say, `ubuntu-mono.css`:

```css
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);

.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "ubuntu-mono.css"]
```

Here I assume `ubuntu-mono.css` is under the same directory as your Rmd.

See [yihui/xaringan#83](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/83) for an example of using the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font, which supports ligatures in program code.

---

# CSS (with Sass)

**xaringan** also supports Sass support via **rmarkdown**. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a `.scss` file, say `mytheme.scss`, using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) syntax with variables:

```scss
$mycolor: #ff0000; 
.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }
.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }
```

Then set the `css` option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: ["default", "mytheme.scss"]
```

This requires **rmarkdown** >= 2.8 and the [**sass**](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/) package. You can learn more about **rmarkdown** and **sass** support in [this blog post](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/15/2021-spring-rmd-news/#sass-and-scss-support-for-html-based-output) and in [**sass** overview vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html).

---

# Themes

Don't want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files `foo.css` and `foo-fonts.css`, where `foo` is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:

```{r, R.options=list(width = 70)}
names(xaringan:::list_css())
```

---

# Themes

To use a theme, you can specify the `css` option as an array of CSS filenames (without the `.css` extensions), e.g.,

```yaml

# Sharingan

The R package name **xaringan** was derived<sup>1</sup> from **Sharingan**, a dōjutsu in the Japanese anime _Naruto_ with two abilities:

- the "Eye of Insight"

- the "Eye of Hypnotism"

I think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even "hypnotize" the audience.<sup>2,3</sup>

.footnote[
[1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of _X_ is _Sh_ /ʃ/ (as in _shrimp_). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name _Xie_.

[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.

[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations.

# Naruto terminology

The **xaringan** package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as

- [Sharingan](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sharingan) (写輪眼; the package name)

- The [moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Moon_Reader) (月読; an attractive R Markdown output format)

- [Chakra](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Chakra) (查克拉; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)

- [Nature transformation](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Nature_Transformation) (性質変化; transform the chakra by setting different options)

- The [infinite moon reader](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Infinite_Tsukuyomi) (無限月読; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)

- The [summoning technique](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Summoning_Technique) (download remark.js from the web)

You can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu "Moon Reader" may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.
