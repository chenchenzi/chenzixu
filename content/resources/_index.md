Open source software packages such as Praat and ESPS have enabled large-scale processing and analysis of speech data. For phoneticians, we often work with first-hand audio data or speech corpora, and begin with the preparation of speech data involving reformatting, transcription, and segmentation. Such pre-processing steps make the speech data searchable and convenient for us to retrieve and extract units of interest.

In the course of my DPhil/PhD studies, I have established a few useful pipelines or workflows that automated some procedures and greatly boosted my efficiency, and accumulated a bunch of scripts. Some scripts are directly downloaded online from those who kindly shared their efforts, others are either adapted from others to suit my own purposes or my nascent attempts in a few programming languages. Dipping my toes in scripting was a steep learning curve (a process of trial and error!) but worthwhile. 

Here I would also like to **share** some scripts of mine (and brief tutorials of how to use them), to pay it forward to the community where their generous sharing helped me a lot. This also serves as an archive of some of my analysis procedures, making the research **open** and **reproducible**.

## Prerequisites
* Bash/Unix Shell Basics in the Terminal
* Basic familiarity with Praat.
* **Googling** or **stackoverflowing** your problems!

I mainly use {{< icon name="terminal" pack="fas" >}} Unix Shell,
{{< icon name="python" pack="fab" >}} Python, {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} R, and Praat in these posts. So it would make more sense to you if you have some very basic ideas about Unix Shell commands and Praat.
