When you write an academic article, how do you cite a research paper? how do you create your bibliography or reference list?

You will greatly benefit from this tutorial if (1) you are still using one of the ways described above to create your bibliography or (2) you have never tried Zotero but want to have a head start. 

Reference management is the unsung hero of academic and professional research. This guide will show you the importance of structured citations, introduce you to one of the best tools, and provide strategies to optimise your research pipeline.
