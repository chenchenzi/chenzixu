When you write an academic article, how do you cite other sources? Have you ever used the following approaches to create your bibliography or reference list?

**A. Copy and Paste** approach: You copy citations from Google Scholar {{< icon name="quote-right" pack="fas" >}}, or existing publications {{< icon name="newspaper" pack="far" >}};

**B. Ad hoc Referencing Generator** approach:  You use a (mostly browser-based) Referencing Generator freely available online or provided by a university to automatically generate formatted academic references in a certain style. Or you use the basic referencing function in Word and add new sources by manually filling the boxes. {{< icon name="laptop-code" pack="fas" >}}

**C. Manual Typing** approach: You are probably a fast-typer and know the rules of citation style by heart. You create the reference texts and adjust the formatting from scratch. {{< icon name="keyboard" pack="fas" >}}

You will greatly benefit from this tutorial if (1) you are still using one of the ways described above to create your bibliography, (2) you want to have a head start on reference management, or (3) you have never tried [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), a free reference management software (this is not an advertisement XD).

This guide will show you the importance of structured citations, introduce you to one of the best tools, and provide strategies to optimise your research pipeline.

## 1.1 Why do we cite?

Briefly speaking, citing sources is a win-win practice for both you and the original author(s) who produced the sources. On their end, citations give their work credit and may reward them with career advancement (in the same line of thinking, you would want others to cite your original ideas or creation too). On your end, with citations you engage in academic conversations, contextualise your topic, and establish your credibility. Most importantly, you **avoid plagiarism**, which can have serious ethical and professional consequences.

## 1.2 What is reference management?

The core of reference management is to (1) collect, (2) organise, and (3) format bibliographic citations. Effective reference management is conducive to seamless academic writing and research, and a good reference management software is the unsung hero of academic and professional research. 

Let's first look at the **drawbacks** of the approaches I mentioned at the beginning.

**A. Consistency and Accuracy** Is the citation style consistent? Are the citations accurate?

Copy and paste may be a quick option in the short term, but the web is inundated with false information. Often the citation options provided by Google Scholar do not strictly follow the latest guide of a citation style. Google Scholar also provides you multiple, sometimes **inconsistent** or **inaccurate**, options.
Below are some Google Scholar citation options of a seminal paper with tracked 88761 references (number based on first search result, as of September 13, 2023 23:00 BST).

>**MLA** Vaswani, Ashish, et al. "Attention is all you need." *Advances in neural information processing systems* 30 (2017).
>
>**APA** Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., ... & Polosukhin, I. (2017). Attention is all you need. *Advances in neural information processing systems, 30*.

Here is another APA option from the second search result (as of September 13, 2023 23:00 BST). We can see that the first author surname `Vaswani` was wrongly spelt.
>**APA** Waswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A., ... & Polosukhin, I. (2017). Attention is all you need. In NIPS.

This paper in fact was from the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) in 2017. Here is another APA option with relatively good APA conference paper format, having skimmed many Google Scholar search results.
> **APA** Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A. N., ... & Polosukhin, I. (2017, December). Attention is all you need. In *Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems* (pp. 6000-6010).

**B. Information Input and Reuse** It is extremely **time-consuming** and painfully **tedious** to manually type your reference list or fill in the boxes of a reference generator. We should probably avoid this as much as possible and divert our efforts on more important things. Ad hoc reference generators may be good for one-time formatting, but not sustainable nor efficient for the long run. If you are going to cite the same paper in many of your writing pieces, you do not want to repeat the same procedure again and again.

**C. Style Shifting?** Popular citation styles include `APA`, `MLA`, `Chicago`, `IEEE`, `Harvard`, etc. If a journal or conference requires a different citation style, it would be an extensive rework if you manually curated the bibliography or copied each source from elsewhere.
