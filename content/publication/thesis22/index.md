abstract: "The city of Changsha, Hunan Province, China has seen an increase in the use of Mandarin in the past decade, overshadowing the local non-Mandarin variety, Changsha. A new variety “Plastic Mandarin”, mostly spoken by millennials and younger generations, has emerged. It is defined in this thesis as a non-standard Mandarin accent that features the speech of young urban residents in Changsha and that has crystallised over the past few decades.

This thesis presents a detailed phonetic investigation of the tonal system of Plastic Mandarin through a cross-varietal comparative approach, mainly divided into two streams: citation tones and neutral tones in contexts. The defining characteristic of the citation tone system for Plastic Mandarin is established first: a mid-level tone, a low to mid rising tone, a low falling tone, and a high rising tone. By comparing the citation tones of the three varieties that coexist in the city of Changsha, the thesis provides acoustic evidence that Plastic Mandarin may arise when Mandarin tones adapt the pitch pattern of some corresponding Changsha tones.

In addition to citation tones, this thesis disentangles the sources of variability in the syllable duration and f0 contour of speech sequences containing neutral tone syllables, i.e. those do not have any of the four canonical lexical tones and often overlooked in prior studies of tones. The data show that f0 contours converge at the end of two consecutive neutral tone syllables at a low pitch in both Mandarin varieties. It suggests that a neutral tone or a sequence of consecutive neutral tones tends to be associated with a low pitch target, despite the varying f0 shapes largely predicted by the preceding lexical tone. The thesis proposes a probabilistic target-approaching model for Mandarin tones in connected speech, in which pitch targets may be fewer than the number of syllables. While the phonetic realisation of the four lexical tones in Plastic Mandarin is consistently different from that in Standard Mandarin, the pitch target of neutral tone syllables tends to remain constant in this process of Mandarin variation and change, which may be attributed to the stable transfer of prosodic structure."
