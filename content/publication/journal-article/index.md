abstract: In the present study, we examine the interactive effect of vowels on Mandarin fricative sibilants using a passive oddball paradigm to determine whether the <sc>HEIGHT</sc> features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence preceding consonants with unspecified features. The stimuli are two pairs of Mandarin words ([sa] ∼ [ʂa] and [su] ∼ [ʂu]) contrasting in vowel <sc>HEIGHT</sc> ([<sc>LOW</sc>] vs. [<sc>HIGH</sc>]). Each word in the same pair was presented both as standard and deviant, resulting in four conditions (/standard/<sub>[deviant]</sub>&#58; /sa/<sub>[ʂa]</sub> ∼ /ʂa/<sub>[sa]</sub> and /su/<sub>[ʂu]</sub> ∼ /ʂu/<sub>[su]</sub>). In line with the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model, asymmetric patterns of processing were found in the [su] ∼ [ʂu] word pair where both the MMN (mismatch negativity) and LDN (late discriminative negativity) components were more negative in /su/<sub>[ʂu]</sub> (mismatch) than in /ʂu/<sub>[su]</sub> (no mismatch), suggesting the spreading of the feature [HIGH] from the vowel [u] to [ʂ] on the surface. In the [sa] ∼ [ʂa] pair, however, symmetric negativities (for both MMN and LDN) were observed as there is no conflict between the surface feature [<sc>LOW</sc>] from [a] to [ʂ] and the underlying specified feature [<sc>LOW</sc>] of [s]. These results confirm that not all features are fully specified in the mental lexicon&#58; features of vowels can spread on the surface and influence surrounding unspecified segments.
