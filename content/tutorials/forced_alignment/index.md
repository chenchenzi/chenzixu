abstract: "A forced alignment system usually takes an audio file and its corresponding transcript as input and returns a text file, which is time-aligned at the phone and word levels. This tutorial walks you through the use of the Penn Forced Aligner (P2FA) and the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) on Mandarin data, from data preparation and installation to post-aligning processing. It integrates curated online resources along with original code snippets to streamline the workflow."
